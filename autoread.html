The ted talk explains the production process by explaining to us the audience how much goes into producing a product or service. It ranges from the employees at the store in which you purchased the product/service, all the way to the person who supplied them the product/service. It is an ongoing cycle in which everyone benefits from. The person who sells the materials or ingredients to create the product/service gets paid, the person who creates the product/service sells it for a greater value & gets paid as well, & lastly the person who purchases the product/service benefits by having something they needed. It has created results for the world and allows products and services to be transported to other countries so that everyone may benefit from them. 

The speaker in the ted talk speaks about the production process in a positive light. He relates the message by explaining to the audience that everything in this world is connected. For instance, the food that we eat on a day-to-day basis. It requires different processes, involves various other individuals to get the product onto the shelves, & in the end we as consumers get to enjoy the result. He emphasizes how big of a role production has for our economy. When people work together to create a product or to provide a service to the public, the rest flows in synchrony & the outcome can be more beneficial rather than negative. 

I never really stopped to think about how production & the processes behind everything have brought immense value to my daily life until now. In some type of way, the services & many of the products created for us through production have brought me a sense of convenience. They just help life become a bit easier to flow through the motions every day. For example, think about the form of transportation used to tend to our daily responsibilities. There are production processes that go into putting together a car. Another example is the food I can supply my body so that I am healthy, again all thanks to production. It makes my life more convenient and allows me to focus on other things to further myself and reach my goals so that I may become the person I want to be in the future. 

 I would like to relate to the speaker AJ Jacobs by saying I am also grateful for the individuals who show up & work together to produce things that are beneficial to the consumers (which is us/myself.) I learned to become more aware of the time & effort that is put into a lot of the things that I value. Reflecting on it now, it seems as though we may put more value on the product itself such as our laptops, cell phones, cars, etc., that we do not think deeper into how it is even possible for these things to exist in our presence at that moment. It took dedication & commitment from someone else to do their role & work together with other people to contribute to us.

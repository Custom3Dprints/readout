Have you ever gone out with your family, and noticed pieces of plastic or water bottles on the street? Or gone out to a lake or river and witnessed pieces of garbage floating in the water's corners? Have you ever wondered how they got there? Or if they even affect us or things around it? As you all know, this is called “pollution”. Water pollution refers to harmful substances that can contaminate body's of water or water ways (Denchak). Water Pollution is harmful to everything on our planet. It kills animals and harms environments, makes our drinking water no longer safe and it can cause long term damage to us humans and even kill us. “Water pollution kills. In fact, it caused 1.8 million deaths in 2015” (Denchak). Moreover, not only can it affect us, but it can also affect the environment and wildlife. Researchers concluded that 86% of all sea turtles they captured had microplastic in them, furthermore 44% of all seabird species and 43% of all marine animals had the same problem, (Lai). Water pollution is a grave environmental catastrophe, having solutions to these matters is as important as helping a family member, because water pollution affects everything and anything. I will now be presenting and explaining possible solutions to this grave matter.
 `	As I mentioned, water pollution is harmful to everything. There are different types of pollution, some being physical hard matter, and others being more of a small thing we can’t see. I would separate pollution into two categories, direct and indirect. Direct being, waste that gets taken out to sea, that comes directly from human populations. And indirect, waste that comes from the things we do. Things such as driving cars, fertilizing plants,etc. According to National Geographic, a passage regarding water pollution, “Scientist found that 80% of plastic waste is distributed by more than 1000 rivers, not simply 10 or 20. They also found that most of that waste is carried by small rivers that flow through the densely populated areas, not the largest rivers” (Parker). In addition to direct pollution, indirect pollution may do as much damage if not more than direct. Simply being because, indirect usually consists of chemicals or oils. Once diluted with water, it's extremely hard to separate both substances from each other. Swimming or drinking from this type of pollution is extremely dangerous, “Once they're ingested, these toxins can cause a lot of health issues, from cancer to hormone disruption to altered brain function” (Denchak). These toxins can also cause something called an “algae bloom”, which in short is an over introduction of nutrients and waste causing a spike in algae. These “nutrients” and “waste” come into the ocean in the form of fertilizers, pesticides, and excrement from animals. These blooms can be harmful to everything in and around water. Killing fish and leaving a “goo” or sludge look to the water, this also makes the water extremely unsafe.
 	Although it's extremely difficult to fix the damage that has been caused by pollution, there are ways we can stop it now and slowly heal the planet. With solutions to our causes, we can slow the rate of which our chemicals and plastics get swept away by the water. The first solution will be regarding direct pollution, microplastics, plastics, hard matter etc. Limit plastic production, which in general sounds too easy but it really isn’t. Although hard to accomplish, if done, this will be the first big solution to slow down pollution in the waterways. When you think about it, all around us is plastic; the table I am typing this from is made of plastic, unfortunately, the toothbrush I brush with is made of plastic, tools, brushes, containers and even medical tools. Plastic is everywhere. But if we can slow production limit it, we can help reduce the amount of waste that leaves our house. “About 11 million tonnes of land-based plastic waste make its way into the ocean each year” (Lai).  A little add-on to this solution is to also reduce the amount of waste you discard. What I mean by this is that, when you finish drinking a water bottle, it can have other uses, it can be re used, if not then it can be recycled. If we can at least cut back half of the waste we produce by recycling it or using it for other uses, plastic producing companies might notice the decline in purchases of items made from plastic, hence possibly slowing down production rate. Which will probably alter the economy, but it's safer to rid or limit plastic and replace it with something else, as opposed to living in a world full of floating debris caused by our own actions that could have been stopped. As for indirect pollution, it won't be the same for indirect pollution.
   	Indirect pollution will have different courses of actions, since indirect pollution has to do mostly with the use of chemicals and oils. “Every time it rains, fertilizers, pesticides, and animal waste from farms and livestock operations wash nutrients and pathogens—such bacteria and viruses—into our waterways” (Denchak). These chemicals can cause something called an algae bloom. In South Florida, I have witnessed algae blooms. It causes a massacre of marine life, leaving a beach of cadavers. With a strong odor, you can smell from far far away. Using less environmentally harsh alternatives can ensure not as many or rarely any chemicals end up in our waters and can also ensure less of these algae blooms, if not any to happen.
 	“Transboundary pollution is the result of contaminated water from one country spilling into the waters of another” (Denchak).). In the years I have been alive, I have only heard of “water treatment plants”	, but never have seen one. I feel like in a world that is mostly water, there should be more water treatment plants. “In the United States, wastewater treatment facilities process about 34 billion gallons of wastewater per day..... But according to EPA estimates, our nation’s aging and easily overwhelmed sewage treatment systems also release more than 850 billion gallons of untreated wastewater each year” (Denchak). If water treatment facilities are “overwhelmed”, why not fund for more? If we are getting pressed by our own waste, the only correct solution to that is to make more water treatment facilities. Have one near every largely populated city or better yet, one near every small river that connects to larger rivers. This way we can regulate the waste that gets washed down. The only downside to this solution is that, when initially building the water plants, since they will be directly on naturally occurring water systems, it might disturb the habitat for the first initial starting times. We as humans have always been able to manufacture things, whether it is for us or for the convenience of others. We can ensure that minimal damage or disturbance will be made to the naturally occurring systems if we are careful enough. 
 	If we as the main creators of earth's problems, we can cooperate. We can shape the world into what it once was. With little pollution, without having the fear of getting sick if you jump into water or drink water. We can help hundreds if not thousands of animal species, bring back the true life that was once taken away by the disease of pollution.  Building more water treatment facilities will ensure the waste from our agriculture and vehicles won’t endanger our waters. Reusing and recycling materials that can be put to more use can help the over production of plastics, ensuring the debris that floats to the ocean will float no more out. Fertilizers and harmful chemicals won’t get washed down to the earth's lungs, because that’s what our waters are. They are lungs, they help ensure the earth is breathing right. Without water, our given green haven will turn into a hellish hot stone grave. You can help at home, whether you think it's too little or you can’t. You can! Re-use, recycle, and tell yourself and others around you to be more considerate of the things they flush, the things they dispose of. Simple things like this will not revert the damage we once caused, but we will heal the earth. Slowly but surely, it can be done, but it can’t be done with just a couple of people. Companies, agencies and communities should prioritize the water they are drinking, the one they will drink, and the one others drink. Earth is currently wrapped and entangled in a net of plastics, it is up to us to free the water ways and free earth and give it the freedom it deserves. To ensure not only good and prosperity for us, but also the world and life around us. We are not the only ones living on this planet. I think it's time people started noticing that we’re the only ones capable of change.

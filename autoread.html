It must explicitly state which of the 5 Intellectual Standards (Clarity, Accuracy, Precision, Relevance, and Logic) you are addressing.
It must contain a question of a classmate's response, or it must be a response addressing questions made about your post.
Note that a single reply may both address a question and post a question. 

For example, if, in your opinion, the reason or rationale someone used in their response was not clear, you can point that out by asking questions of Clarity and by addressing what was unclear about the statement.

An effective reply may look like this; Clarity and Precision can be improved. "when you wrote about _________, I was not sure if you meant _________ or ________. Can you say that in a different way? Can you be more specific?".

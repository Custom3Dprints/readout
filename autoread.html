hello and welcome to this library and research skills tutorial
this tutorial will show you how to search the libraries databases like a
pro
i will show you a few techniques that you can apply to most database searches
these techniques will help you be more successful an efficient in finding what
you need
when you need to search for scholarly articles
and helps a lot if you start by formulating your topic into a research
question
this will help you stay focused
or research question is the question that you will discuss and provide an
answer to in your paper
next you'll need to break down that question into its key concepts
key concepts of the main themes of the main players if you will involved in
your research question
this will help you choose the best keywords to use
when searching in a database
let's use this student research question as an example
do violent video games contributed violent behavior in children and
teenagers
the key concepts for this topic would be
video games
violence
and teenagers or children
even though it may seem like the right thing to do you wouldn't include phrases
such as the effects of
or the influence of in your key concepts
or a search terms
because these terms are too specific
remember you want to start with only the major themes of your topic to get the
best results
the next step is to think of synonyms and
or related terms
for your key concepts
in the thousands of relevant articles that may be out there
they may not all discussed the topic using the same vocabulary
by creating a list of synonyms or related terms
you are also creating a list of keywords you can use to find the relevant
articles in the database
in some cases there may not be any synonymous terms if a concept is only
expressed by one commonly used term
that would be the case with video games in this example
video games is really the only commonly used english term
we can however think of synonyms for the other terms
violence could also be expressed as
aggression
for teenagers you could also use the word adolescents
and of course who are also interested in the effects videogames on children
so that term needs to be included as well
the synonyms or related terms are linked by the operator or
this tells the database to retrieve any documents that employees not only the
first term you thought of
but documents that use the synonymous related terms that might also be used to
discuss the particular concept
each key concept group synonyms and related terms is linked to the other key
concept group or groups by the operator and
organizing your key concepts in this way prepares you to make the most efficient
searching a database
now I will explain two techniques that you can use in most databases
to ensure that you'll be retrieving all of the relevant documents for your topic
the first is called phrasal searching
when one of your terms consists more than one word you want to make sure that
the search engine of the database
finds your exact term
and not each separate word in different locations
for instance in some databases if you enter video games just as is
it may retrieve documents that contain the word "video" in one place
and "games" in another part of the document
my putting double quotes around the term video games
you will on lean retrieve documents containing the two words next to one
another
in other words you only retrieved documents that mentioned video games
another useful technique is called truncation
truncation is when you replace the ending of the root word with a symbol
this tells a search engine to retrieve documents containing all variant forms
the root word
most often the symbol for truncation isn't asterix
but you can always check a databases help piles under truncation
to make sure you're using the correct symbol symbol for that database
here's an example truncation if we enter child
within asterix
the database would retrieve documents containing
child, as is
child's apostrophe s
children
and childhood
another example with adolescent with an asterix at the end
would retrieve
adolescent
the noun or the adjective
adolescence
the noun in plural
adolescents with an apostrophe s
and adolescence
with a "ce" ending
for this particular search we can use truncation for other terms as well
further word aggression we can make it so that it also retrieves documents that
talk about aggressive behavior as well as aggression
by using truncation your insuring that you'll retrieve his many relevant
documents as possible regardless of the language they use to describe the topic
first we're going to look at a database called Sociological abstracts by CSA
now we're going to enter our key concepts and their synonyms
or related terms into the search boxes
This type of thorough search is sure to provide you with relevant articles
Let me point out something about this database, notice that it is separated
the search results by the type of document it has retrieved
as you can see there are different tabs they're labeled
all publication types
journals
peer reviewed journals
if your assignment requires that you use scholarly or peer-reviewed documents
you should only choose articles from the result forget peer-reviewed journals tab
that means that all of those results
are peer-reviewed articles
most of the libraries databases provide the means to limit your results
to scholarly or peer-reviewed articles
in the next example I'll show you how to do this in a different database.
If you're not sure what scholarly or peer-reviewed means
watch the libraries video about peer review or ask your course instructor or
teaching assistant.
Let's briefly look at another research question in a different database to make
sure you understand how to use these techniques.
This student wants to write about what causes the public to accept or oppose
having a wind farm near where they live
Here's his research question
he's broken it down into the following key concepts
wind farms and public acceptance
again it's important to think of the synonyms or related terms so that you
can retrieve all possible relevant documents
this student realizes that wind farms could also be discussed by the terms
wind power
wind energy
or wind turbines
and for a second concept
public acceptance
could also be discussed under the term public opposition
public perception
or public attitudes
here's what our complete search terms will look like since we're searching for
keywords anywhere in the documents
we should use the phrasal searching so that it finds terms like wind power as
one term and not as two separate words
In this case will only use truncation for the term public perception
because it could appear in the singular or the plural form
let's see how we would enter these in the database that uses
the Ebsco search interface
We're going to look at a multi-disciplinary database called academic search premier
So here we go this is what our search terms will look like in the search boxes
of the database noticed that each key concept and that synonymous terms are in
one search box
and each synonymous turn
is separated by the operator OR
and selecting peer-reviewed documents because
those are the kinds of articles I need
these kinds of thorough searches are certain to retrieve relevant documents
the techniques I've shown you in this tutorial can be used in most academic
databases
If you want to learn some other research skills make sure you look at the list of
video tutorials on the library's help page
if you have any questions about what was shown in this video
where you want to know about other techniques for searching databases
you can always ask a librarian
You can talk to a librarian at the reference desk of the library or via the
library's online chat
but you can email us at reference at brock u

Thanks for listening, and good luck with your research

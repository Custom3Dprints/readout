We need to start from the notion that resources (things used to produce other things) are limited, and this limit or scarcity  requires us to make choices. Because we can’t have it all, we must decide what we are going to have and what we must forgo. Individuals, businesses, and nations face alternatives, and choices must be made. Economics studies how these choices are made.

Scarcity is a situation in which the ingredients for producing the things that people desire are insufficient to satisfy all wants. All economic analysis derives from this condition. Wants: What people would buy if their incomes were unlimited. Wants can be thought of as goods and services on which we place a positive value. Production: The process of converting resources  into goods and services.

Economics is the study of the ways individuals, firms (businesses), and society make decisions to allocate limited resources to competing wants.  The study of how people make choices under conditions of scarcity. All societies regardless of the country or its circumstances have to answer 3 basic economic questions: (1) What goods and services are to be produced?  (2) How are these goods and services produced?  (3) Who will receive these goods and services? How that is done depends on who owns the resources, and how decisions are made to coordinate production and distribution. In a capitalist or market economy, private individuals and firms own most of the resources. The what, how and who decisions are determined by individual desires for good and services and profit-making decisions by firms. Product prices are the principal mechanism for communicating information in the system. Based on prices, consumers decide whether to buy or not, and firms decide how to employ their resources and what technology to use. Producers are free to survive or perish based on their choices. 

Resources or Factors of Production are things or inputs used in the production of things that people want. We can classify resources into categories; Land, Labor (including Human Capital),  Physical Capital and Entrepreneurship or Entrepreneurial Ability. Land is often called the natural resource, and consists of all the gifts of nature (e.g., minerals, trees, etc.). Physical Capital or Capital includes all manufactured resources that are used to produce other goods (e.g., construction crane). It also includes improvements to natural resources, such as irrigation ditches. Labor is the human resource that includes all productive contributions made by individuals who work, involving both mental and physical activities. Human Capital is the accumulated training and education workers receive that increases their productivity. Entrepreneurship refers to human resources that perform the functions of organizing, managing, and assembling other factors of production to create and operate business ventures, and takes the risks associated with introducing new methods and other types of new thinking that could lead to wealth creation.
 
Scarcity requires that choices be made. When one choice is made, then another is given up. Whenever you engage in any activity using any resource you are trading off the use of that resource for one or more alternative uses. For example, the more time devoted to studying economics, the less time that can be devoted to studying history. Thus, a higher grade in economics has a “cost” of a lower history grade. This cost is known in economics as the Opportunity Cost. The highest valued, next-best alternative that must be sacrificed for the choice that was made. In economics, cost is always a forgone opportunity.
 
In a world of scarcity being able to make good use of resources is very important. In other words, efficiency is important. In economics we look at efficiency in 2 ways; Production Efficiency and Allocative Efficiency.  Production Efficiency is the case in which a given level of resources is used to produce the maximum output possible. It is also a situation in which a given output is produced at a minimum cost. Allocative Efficiency occurs when the mix of goods and services produced is the most desired by society. 
 
Specialization means working at a relatively well-defined, limited activity. Specialization only makes sense because of the concept of Comparative Advantage. Comparative Advantage is the ability to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost compared to other producers. The relationship between Specialization and Comparative Advantage is the basis for exchange. If each person, region, and country specializes in producing those things that they can produce relatively most efficiently, then it is possible to increase output without increasing the total amount of resources. Persons who are making decisions that further their self-interest will make choices that aim to maximize their benefits. The result is that they choose their comparative advantage and end up specializing.  Absolute Advantage is the ability to produce more units of a good or service using a given quantity of resource inputs.

As we have seen, every country has to decide what to produce, how to produce it, and decide who receives the output. Countries desire to do the first two as efficiently as possible by choosing the production method that results in the greatest output using the least amount of resources. How resources are used is as important as the amount of resources available.

Every economy faces constraints or limitations. Land, labor, capital, and entrepreneurship are all limited. No country has an infinite supply of available workers or the space and machinery that would be needed to put them all to work efficiently. No country can break free of these natural restraints. Such limits are known as Production Possibilities Frontiers. In fact, individuals, firms and countries in all economies face constraints on their production capabilities. Production can be limited by the quantity of the various resources at hand and by technology. Technology includes such considerations as knowledge about production methods, the country’s infrastructure, etc.

To further simplify matters, production possibilities analysis assumes that the quantity of resources and the technology available remain constant, and that the economic agent in question (individuals, firms, countries) produces only two products. Although a two-product world sounds far-fetched, this simplification allows us to analyze many important concepts regarding production and tradeoffs. Further, the conclusions drawn from this simple model will not differ fundamentally from a more complex model of the real world. The Production Possibilities Frontier (PPF) is a graph that shows the maximum combinations of two goods that are possible  to produce. Points on or inside the PPF are attainable, and those outside of the frontier are unattainable.

Using the production possibilities analysis is the simplest way to illustrate the Opportunity Cost associated with choices, as well as the concept of Comparative Advantage.  Recall that Opportunity Cost is the highest valued, next-best alternative that must be sacrificed for the choice that was made. In economics, cost is always a foregone opportunity. Comparative Advantage is the ability to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost compared to other producers or other productive activities. Absolute Advantage is the ability to produce more units of a good or service using a given quantity of resource inputs.

Increasing Opportunity Costs: In most cases, land, labor, and capital cannot easily be shifted from producing one good or service to another. You cannot take a semitrailer and use it to plow a field, even though the semi and a top-of-the-line tractor cost about the same. The fact is that some resources are suited to specific sorts of production, just as some people seem to be better suited to performing one activity over another. Some people have a talent for music or art, and they would be miserable—and inefficient—working as accountants or computer programmers. Some people find they are more comfortable working outside, while others require the amenities of an environmentally controlled, ergonomically designed office.

Thus, a more realistic production possibilities frontier is concave to (or bowed away from) the origin (see graph below), because opportunity costs rise as more factors are used to produce increasing quantities of one product. However, if you are comparing two productive activities that are very similar, and resources can be shifted from one activity to the next without much effort, you might end up with a downward sloping straight line.
